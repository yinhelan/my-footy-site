title: Poisson distribution for football goals

## What problem Poisson solves
When you want to estimate the probability that a team scores 0/1/2... goals, the Poisson model is a simple baseline.

## The formula
P(k; 位) = e^{-位} * 位^k / k!

## How to estimate 位
Use recent matches to get average goals; calibrate with league average & home advantage.

## From single-team goals to scoreline
Assume independence; multiply two teams' goal distributions to get P(i,j).
